//   Public : this class can be accessed from anywhere
//   Class : Name group og properties and functions
//   Methods : All the functions in the classes is called methods
//   Main: name of the file
//   If the name of the file is main.java than the public class has to be the same name
//   Different name is not allowed.
//   Even in the function the name must be main otherwise the program won't run.
//   whenever you run for the java file it will look for the main function in it
//   if the main function is not there your code will not run
//   "Main" function is the entry point of the java program
//   Static : To run a function without creating an object in the class
//   Void : because we don't want the program to give any returns (no value)
//   String [] args : Collection of strings. Command line argument
//   Package : It's the folder in which your java file is located.
//   Its important because we need to provide sometimes some form of rules.
//   for e.g: this function can only be accessed to the files that are in this package
//   Basic functions: sout : System.out.println(); System.out.print() (without a new line)
//   System Class: For all the output functions and methods
//   Scanner Class: For all the input functions and methods. It is available in util package
//   System.out : standard default output stream - Command line. Which you can change to file etc
//   System. in : standard default input stream - Keyboard input
